### Decision: Multi-Level Supervision Tree
**Status**: âœ… Decided
**Rationale**:
- Perfect fault isolation between entity types
- Different restart strategies for different entity types
- Easy to scale and manage
- Natural OTP supervision patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single supervisor for all entities (poor fault isolation)

- Custom supervision logic (reinventing OTP)

### Decision: Centralized Entity Registry with Indexing
**Status**: âœ… Decided
**Rationale**:
- Fast entity lookups by various criteria
- Centralized entity lifecycle management
- Easy to query and filter entities
- Performance through smart indexing

**Alternatives Considered**:

### Decision: Rule-Based Spawning System
**Status**: âœ… Decided
**Rationale**:
- Configurable without code changes

- Easy to modify spawn behaviors
- Supports complex spawn conditions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hard-coded spawning logic (not flexible)
- Simple random spawning (no control)
- Manual entity creation only (not scalable)

## 2025-01-XX - Layered World System Design

### Decision: ASCII-Based Map Representation
**Status**: âœ… Decided
**Rationale**:
- Human-readable and debuggable
- Easy to edit manually or programmatically
- Compact storage format
- Natural fit with text-based MUD interface
- Can represent complex spatial relationships with simple characters

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Binary map format (harder to debug, edit)
- JSON-based maps (more verbose, harder to visualize)
- Vector-based coordinates (complex for tile-based systems)

### Decision: Minimal Core Layer Set
**Status**: âœ… Decided
**Rationale**:
- Ground: Foundation for all other layers
- Atmosphere: Environmental effects and visibility
- Plants: Dynamic vegetation and resources
- Structures: Buildings and architectural elements

- Doors: Passageways and zone transitions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single monolithic layer (too complex, hard to manage)
- Too many specialized layers (over-engineering)
