# Devlog - 2025-08-16

## 🚀 Project Kickoff

Starting a MUD revival project using Elixir! The goal is to build a modern, scalable MUD engine that leverages Elixir's actor-based design. #Elixir #MUD #GameDev

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

Decided on ECS + Actor model for the core architecture. Each game entity will be a GenServer, with components stored as data. World ticks every 3 seconds using GenStage. #ECS #ActorModel #GenStage

## 📚 Documentation Complete

Created comprehensive design docs covering:
- High-level project vision
- Technical architecture specs  
- Entity system design
- LiveView interface design
- Decision tracking system

The foundation is solid and well-documented! #Documentation #Design

## 🎮 Entity System Foundation

Successfully implemented the core entity system:
- Entity GenServer with component management
- Entity Registry for lookup and indexing
- Multi-level supervision tree
- Health component with regeneration logic
- Comprehensive test coverage

All tests passing! The entity foundation is rock solid. #EntitySystem #Testing #OTP

## 🖥️ User Interface Design

Designed the LiveView-based user interface architecture:
- Three terminal-style chat boxes (World, Local, System)
- Real-time messaging system
- Command processing pipeline
- Entity interaction interface
- Responsive layout with upper 2/3 game world, lower 1/3 chat

The UI design is comprehensive and ready for implementation! #LiveView #UI #UX

## ✅ LiveView Interface Implementation

Successfully implemented the complete LiveView interface:
- Main game LiveView with three chat channels
- Command processing system (look, move, say, help)
- Real-time message handling and display
- Responsive CSS styling with terminal aesthetic
- JavaScript hooks for interactive features
- Comprehensive test coverage

The interface is fully functional and ready for integration with the entity system! #LiveView #Implementation #Testing

## 🔄 Next Steps

Ready to integrate the LiveView interface with the entity system:
1. Connect command processing to entity actions
2. Implement real-time entity updates
3. Add world tick integration
4. Build entity spawning interface
5. Add more game commands and interactions

## ❓ Pending Questions

- Should we implement message persistence for chat history?
- How granular should the command validation be?
- What's the optimal message batching strategy for performance?

## 🎯 Vision

Building a MUD that feels modern and responsive while maintaining the classic text-based charm. The LiveView interface will provide real-time updates and smooth interactions that make the world feel alive and engaging. #MUDRevival #ModernMUD
